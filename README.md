A multi-agent AI system for **real-time detection, classification, and response to blockchain exploits**. Built during my internship, it orchestrates specialized agents using **LangGraph** to monitor real-time events, classify threats with LLMs (OpenAI/Groq fallback), match against historical attacks via **Pinecone vector search**, and suggest remediations. Handles fast-moving threats like flash loans, token dumps, and governance attacks with sub-second latency.

This project demonstrates skills in **AI orchestration**, **vector databases**, **real-time systems**, and **blockchain integration**.

## üéØ Features
- **Anomaly Detection**: Rules-based (extensible to ML) flagging of suspicious patterns.
- **Exploit Classification**: LLM-powered categorization (e.g., Flash Loan, Oracle Manipulation) with fallback reliability.
- **Historical Matching**: Pinecone vector search against a database of real exploits.
- **Remediation Advice**: Actionable recommendations like pausing contracts or alerting DAOs.
- **Human-Readable Reports**: Summarized incident reports with confidence scores and next steps.
- **Scalable Architecture**: FastAPI API + LangGraph for async processing; easy to extend to multi-chain.
