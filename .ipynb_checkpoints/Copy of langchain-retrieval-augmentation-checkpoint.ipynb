In 1923, he attacked the island of Corfu, and in 1924, he occupied the city state of Fiume. In 1935, he attacked the African country Abyssinia (now called Ethiopia). His forces occupied it in 1936.

Mussolini attacked Greece, but he failed to conquer it. In 1943, the Allies landed in Southern Italy.
